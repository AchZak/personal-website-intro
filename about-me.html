    <section class="bio">
        <p>I hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree from ULB. My professional journey includes roles as a private tutor and science teacher, 
            where I've had the privilege of imparting knowledge and fostering curiosity in others. 
            Alongside my academic pursuits, I've cultivated some coding skills both through formal studies and personal exploration.</p>

        <p>
            When it comes to interests, I've always had a thing for science; there's just something about unraveling the mysteries of the world that gets me hooked. 
            Programming is another one of my passions. I like how it challenges me to think critically and solve problems creatively. 
            Watching debates is a bit of a guilty pleasureâ€”I find it fascinating to hear people argue their points and see how ideas clash and evolve. 
            These interests keep me grounded and always looking for new ways to learn and grow.
